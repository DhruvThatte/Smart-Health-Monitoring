# 🏥 Smart Health Monitoring System using ESP32  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Smart Health Monitoring System** is an IoT-based project that continuously monitors health parameters like **body temperature** and transmits the data to a cloud-based dashboard (**Node-RED**). The system uses an **ESP32** microcontroller, **DS18B20** temperature sensor, and **Wi-Fi connectivity** to provide real-time health tracking.  

This project is **ideal for elderly patients and remote health monitoring**, allowing caregivers and doctors to monitor health data from anywhere.
